This is an addon in the spirit of Sphere mods ported to Vanilla, with a focus on Turtle WoW

I've added mainly solo seals and blessings to make my leveling a bit easier, for group Blessings, see my
version of Pally Power.

-- Initial Release.

I've done my best to put in what I would say is useful solo Paladin play, so at this stage no greater blessings,
no blessings for other characters

I'll try and add in a counter for symbols, fix up the display for mana

Feedback is welcome.
